  <h2>PayPal Checkout </h2>
  PayPal Checkout (formerly known as Express Checkout) is a way to integrate and
  streamline the checkout process on your website or mobile app. Your customers
  can pay on your website or mobile app with thier card or PayPal account, using
  their shipping and billing information already stored securely at PayPal so
  they don’t have to re-enter it on your site. They'll remain on your site or
  page throughout the checkout process. By setting up your own customized
  layout, you can ensure a smooth and uninterrupted shopping experience for your
  customers. How does it work? PayPal Checkout can be integrated directly into
  your website or as an add-on to a shopping cart. If you already have a
  shopping cart or are working with a provider that is pre-integrated with
  PayPal, it’s likely that all you’ll need is your PayPal login or PayPal API
  credentials for integration. With some knowledge of API programming, you can
  also add PayPal Checkout to your website without a shopping cart. You can view
  more details and the required steps in our integration guide in the Developer
  portal.
